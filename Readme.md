# Desktop BEAVER

The Body ECU for Air-cooled Volkswagen with Extended Reliability (BEAVER) project ignores the notion that the platform is reliable because of it's simple parts.  But also does not overcomplicate the system with needlessly complex parts.  It replaces several parts behind the dash with a single ECU based on a mature microcontroller with solid state switching.  This enables CAN based configuration, diagnostic protocols and longer mean time between failures.
